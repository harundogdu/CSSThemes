            <p class="description">Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one:
                a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
                eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth
                which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in
                practice, not in theory.</p>
            <p class="description">Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil.
                But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from
                science.</p>
            <p class="description">What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the
                Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
            </p>
            <p class="description">A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her
                beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the
                first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
            <p class="description">For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps
                thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we
                share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">The Final Frontier</h3>
            <p class="description">There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively
                and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there
                is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
            <p class="description" style="color:#6c757d; font-style: italic;">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of
                today and the
                reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and
                yet far too little for the next ten.</p>
            <p class="description">Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group
                of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of
                human development.</p>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Reaching for the Stars</h3>
            <p class="description">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it
                shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object
                looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.
                Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p class="description">Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its
                five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly
                go where no man has gone before.</p>
            <p class="description">As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize
                there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
